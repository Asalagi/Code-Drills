//Practice one - reverse a string. 

function soluntion(str){
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

// Practice Two - Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, 
// representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), 
// which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

function cookingTime(eggs) {
    let minutes = Math.abs(5); // non negative num, 5 min is boiling time and math.abs makes positive num
    let eggMax = 8; // 8 is the number of max eggs that can but boiled
    return ; // head getting to mathy I don't know how to display what it wants
